### Coding standards
<a name="Coding standards"></a>

In order to follow code standards, you should use PSR-2, PSR-12 and run [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/PHP-CS-Fixer) before each commit to make sure your code is properly formatted. Base CS fixer configuration file has created as `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php` to make sure every developer uses the same rules for code formatting.  Exact version that should be used is installed as dependency so you can use 
```bash
cd entry
composer fixer
```
#### Configuration
This is file located in `entry` folder, `.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`

### PHPStan
<a name="phpstan"></a>

#### Usage
```bash
cd entry
composer phpstan
```

### L5-Swagger
<a name="l5-swagger"></a>

#### Usage
```bash
cd entry
composer swagger
```
This will generate two files in folder `storage/api-doc` called `api-docs.json` and `resources/views/vendor/l5-swagger/index.blade.php`.

#### Configuration
OpenApi documentation is configured in laravel config file located in `entry/config/l5-swagger.php`.

Also, basic OpenAPI properties are definied in `entry/app/Http/OpenApi/Controllers/ControllerOA.php`.

#### Usage
```bash
cd entry
php artisan ide-helper:generate
php artisan ide-helper:meta
php artisan ide-helper:models --nowrite
```
Currently we use only feature to generate PhpStorm meta file.

            [...]
            "NewDomain\\": "../NewDomain/"
        }
    },
   ```
   **Remember to sort by name.**

3. Modify PHP-CS-Fixer config `entry/.php-cs-fixer.dist.php`:
   ```
    ->in([
